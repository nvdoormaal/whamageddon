# whamageddon
An Shiny app for showing the results of annual Whamageddon contest: https://daikoro.shinyapps.io/Whamageddon/

## **Rules of Whamageddon**
### The first rule
The objective is to go as long as possible without hearing WHAM's Christmas classic; ["Last Christmas"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8gmARGvPlI&ab_channel=WhamVEVO).
### The 2nd Rule
The game starts on December 1st, and finishes at the end of December 24th. Use your local timezone, if you'd like (yes, we're European heathens).
### The 3rd Rule
Only the original version applies. Enjoy the ?#!$&%! out of remixes and covers.
### The 4th Rule
You're out as soon as you recognise the song.
### PvP?
While we can't stop you from deliberately sending your friends to Whamhalla, the intention is that this is a survival game. Not a Battle Royale. So ... play nicely, mkay?
